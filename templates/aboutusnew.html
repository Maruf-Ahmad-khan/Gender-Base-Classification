                <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; color:#808000">The Department of Computer Engineering was incepted in the year 2007 with the vision, “To create an environment in which new ideas, research and technology development and the technocrats and innovators of tomorrow become competent to face the global challenges”. In these academic years Department of Computer Engineering (CS), PIET has achieved a lot of success and earned many achievements. I am glad to inform that the Department has been accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in the year 2017-18 and it is now in the elite list of departments in India. It has taken the initiative to start its own portal for home assignment submission and awarding marks. Many other software tools are also used which are developed by the faculty members and students of the Department such as cspiet.poornima.org, KYS, cstech.poornima.org. Because of all these efforts and teamwork, the Department has been recognized as one of the most innovative departments in Poornima Foundation.</p>
